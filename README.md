# About The Project

This is a project I built with ReactJS. It is a food order app called 'OrderWay' which allows you to choose various different meals from a list, add them to a cart and order them.
The project is built with functional components and makes use of React Hooks as well as custom hooks. The all data is stored and fetched from a Firebase backend.

  The app goes inactive after not being used for a while, so let it load for a bit while it becomes active again.
  
## Usage

Simply select the foods you want to eat as well as the amount per item and add it to your cart by clicking "Add". Once in the cart, confirm your cart items by clicking "Order". 
A form will appear below where you enter your information. Once you have clicked "Confirm", your information will be validated and then sent to the backend. There is no real 
food order process happening, the data is simply sent and stored in a database
